# PID_controller
 ##balancing_2bldc.ino
 This is an arduino code for autonomous balancing of 2 BLDCs placed at ends of a rod. Hardware is designed to study, how PID
 controller works on DRONES. we have achieved the autonomous balancing of drone after applying unknown external disturbance.
 PID tuning is done by trial and error.

 ##pid_cruise_controller.m
 This is a MATLAB code to implement PID controller for a car whose current velocity and desired velocit are known. PID 
 controller is implemented to achieve desired velocity smoothly.
